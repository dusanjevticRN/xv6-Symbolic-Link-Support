# xv6-Symbolic-Link-Support
This project introduces symbolic link support to xv6, enabling files to point to other files or directories. It includes functionality for creating and managing symbolic links, preventing automatic following of links, and detecting link cycles. Users can create links, view information about them, and track file space usage.
