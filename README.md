# xv6-Symbolic-Link-Support
I have introduced symbolic link support to xv6, allowing files to point to other files or directories. This update includes functionality for creating and managing symbolic links, prevents automatic following of links, and detects link cycles. Users can now create links, view information about them, and track file space usage
